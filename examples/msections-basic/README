Scenario for simple usage of mutual sections(msections).

Two processes are created within single partition.

The first process with low priority starts immediately after switching into NORMAL mode.
The process enters into the msection and do some work.

The second process with high priority starts 20 ms after switching into NORMAL mode.
It also wants to enter into the msection, but the msection is busy.

Because the msection is already entered by the first process, it continues
its execution for the time of the second process. But when the first process
leaves the msection, control is immediately returned to the second process.

Possible partition's output is:

---
First process starts.
First process has been entered mutual section.
pok_gdb_thread
Second process starts.
First process is leaving the section.
Second process has been entered mutual section.
Second process is leaving the section.
Second process is finishing.
First process is finishing.
---

Note, that while the first process leaves msection first, it is finished
only after the second process.

(TODO: Not sure why, but it is possible for the second process to start
before the first one.
In that case msection is useless: because of high priority, the second
process do all its work until STOP(). Only then the first process runs.)
