Scenario for waiting on msection.

Two processes are created within single partition.

High priority process (the second) starts first.process with high priority starts 20 ms after switching into NORMAL mode.
It enters into critical section, check 'completion' variable and waits if it is 0.

Low priority process (the first) starts then.
It enters into critical section, sets 'completion' variable to 1 and notify the second thread.

Possible partition's output is:

---
process 1 created
process 1 "started" (it won't actually run until operating mode becomes NORMAL)
process 2 created
process 2 "started" (it won't actually run until operating mode becomes NORMAL)
Second process starts.
Second process waits for completion.
First process starts.
Notify second thread
Second process resumes.
Second process is finishing.
First process is finishing.
