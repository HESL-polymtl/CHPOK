Two similar ARINC653 applications are run on different modules, each module
uses its own CPU.

It needs additional configuration options:

    #define JET_CONFIG_SMP 1
    #define JET_CONFIG_SMP_NR_CPUS 2

and additional QEMU options for run this example:

    -smp 2 -m 512

Currently, there is no inter-module communication.
