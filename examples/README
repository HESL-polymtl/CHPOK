When copy example into your private location (your own package), cleanup
heading lines of:

    <example>/SConstruct

and (for every partition in it)

    <example>/<partition>/SConstruct

Since copiing, you are free to modify these files.

Up-to-day content of these files in JetOS is located in files

    SConstruct_module

and

    SConstruct_partition

correspondingly.


DEVELOPER:

Whenever example is added or removed or partition's list in it is modified,
update 'examples_dirs' variable in SConstruct accordingly.
