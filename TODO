core/syscall.c:371 fix before merging in master!

currently in eflags IOPL bits are set on every context_switch to all partitions. Make setting IOPL only for system_partition

remove `pok_error_raise_partition(part_id, POK_ERROR_KIND_PARTITION_CONFIGUR    ATION)` from loader.c both for ppc and x86

pok_port_size_t is unsigned but MESSAGE_SIZE_TYPE is signed, and there are casts between them

libpok/middleware/queueinit.c unused file
libpok/middleware/resourses.c unused file?

POK_NEEDS_PORTS_VIRTUAL never set

KERNEL
========================================================================
 - Make a little memory allocator for the kernel space
 - Implement the health monitor that is near of the ARINC653 definition
 - Implement FIFO scheduler
 - Implement queueing discipline
 - CHECK MAIN KERNEL THREAD STACK SIZE

LIBPOK
========================================================================
 - Create an API that implements ARINC653 APEX
 - Create an API that implements POSIX
 - Implement fault callback function

GENERAL
========================================================================
 - Make a tool that handle dependencies between NEEDS maccro

POKCHECKER
========================================================================
 - Checks that Sum (Thread_Code_Data_Size) < Partition_Memory_Code_Size
 - Checks that Partition_Duration < Sum(Window_Schedule_Duration)
 - Checks that No Window_Schedule overlap in Major Frame
 - Checks that Period of a periodic thread is a multiple of Partition period

CODE GENERATION
========================================================================
 - handle lockobjects for partitions and kernel
 - add POK_NEEDS_LOCKJECTS and so on
