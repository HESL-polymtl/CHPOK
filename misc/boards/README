Scripts for build JetOS against specific board.


Each subdirectory corresponds to board with the same name and should
contain:

1. 'SConscript'.

SCons script file which is called from 'misc/SConscript'.
This script should import SCons environment 'env' via

   Import('env')

and should fill some environment variables in it:

 - 'ARCH' - target architecture, corresponded to given BSP.
 (String, required).

 - 'PREFIX' - prefix of toolchain tools used for compile, link, etc.
 (String, required).

 - 'BOARD_DEPLOY' - function, which is called as
 
    f(env, memory_definitions_file, memory_constraints)
    
 where
 
   -- 'memory_definitions_file' - path to the file, where memory
   definitions (see 'memory_definitions.py') should be stored
   (via serialization);
   
   -- 'memory_costraints' - single-element list contained 'SCons.Node'
   object referred to the file with memory constraints (see 'memory_definitions.py').
   
   The function should define rule which for given *memory constraints*
   creates *memory definitions*.
   
   Note, that *memory constraints* doesn't define memory blocks for
   partitions' code and data, contained in partitions' elf files.
   But *memory definitions* should define such blocks.
   
   The function may define rule(s) for create board-specific deployment file(s),
   and append these file(s) to env['BOARD_DEPLOYMENT_SOURCES'], so these
   files will be compiled into the resulted module object.
   
   The function may use environment variables:
   
   --- 'MODULE_BUILD_DIR' - where additional files should be created.
   --- 'PARTITIONS_ELF_MAP' - mapping from partition's name into
                              partition's elf file.

 - 'GDB' - gdb executable for debug. If absent, PREFIX'ed version is used.
 (String/path, optional).

 - 'BOARD_IS_EMULATED' - whether given board can be emulated using qemu.
 For emulated board scons targets for running module are automatically
 generated.
 (Boolean, optional)

 - 'QEMU' - qemu executable for run.
 Used only for emulated boards (see description for BOARD_IS_EMULATED above).
 (String/path, required if BOARD_IS_EMULATED is true).

 - 'QEMU_FLAGS' - flags for run qemu.
 Used only for emulated boards (see description for BOARD_IS_EMULATED above).
 (Space-separated string, required if BOARD_IS_EMULATED is true).

 - 'CFLAGS' - may append additional flags for compile "C" sources.

 - 'CFLAGS_KERNEL' - may append additional flags for compile "C" sources
 for kernel space.

 - 'AFLAGS' - may append additional flags for compile asm sources.
