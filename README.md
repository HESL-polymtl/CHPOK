JetOS project was started as a fork of [POK](http://pok.tuxfamily.org/) that is an open source ARINC-653 compliant real-time operating system. All the changes made are provided as open source software under GPLv3 license.

Since then, code has been significantly rewritten and the new operating system have got a new name: *JetOS*.

The key new features include:
* preemptible kernel;
* APEX services complying to ARINC-653 part 1 specification;
* IO partitions with UDP/IP networking stack and device drivers;
* gdb server supporting debugging kernel and user partitions.

JetOS supports PowerPC(Book E) and x86.
